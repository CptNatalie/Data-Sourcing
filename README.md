# data-sourcing-challenge

There's so much I could say about how challenging this Module 6 homework was for me. 
It was significantly less straightforward than the last challenges.
I couldn't get the URL's to work. I have significant doubts that my results are correct.
I wanted to comprehend this lesson better than I did.


The Readme for this challenge says: 
You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

I consulted my teacher Anthony, teachers assistants, class mates, & ChatGPT for this one.
