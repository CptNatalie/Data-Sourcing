# Data Sourcing Project

Prepare data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. Extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Internet Movie Database (IMDB), then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
